## Intro

LaraDock strives to get closer to developers, providing flexible, powerful and simple tools. We would like a Phalcon
development process to be effortless and pleasant. It contains pre-packaged Docker Images that provides you a wonderful
development environment without requiring you to install PHP, NGINX, MySQL, REDIS, and any other software on your local
machine.

**Usage Overview:** Run `NGINX`, `MySQL` and `Redis`.

```shell
docker-compose up  nginx mysql redis
```
